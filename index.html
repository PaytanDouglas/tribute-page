        <p class="boxoinfo">Katsuki Bakugou (爆豪 勝己) is one of the main characters in the manga and anime Boku no Hero Acadamia (aka My Hero Acadamia). He is one of the many students in Class 1-A of the U.A. First Year Classes. The series is made by Kohei Horikoshi.</p>

        <p>Katsuki Bakugo is usually referred to Bakugou by his peers, although he has been given the name by a childhood friend/rival Izuku Midoriya. In the beginning of both the manga series and anime adaptation he is shown to be fierce and overly self confident. He is sure of his own success and considers others “extras”, soon later he is seen calling Izuku Midoriya “Deku” (meaning ‘useless’ in Japanese) continuing on to destroying Midoriya’s book about heroes.</p>

        <p>Although at first Bakugou seemed rude throughout the anime and manga it is clear he has other sides to him. He looks up to All Might (the top Pro-Hero in Japan) and strives to be just like him. He’s courageous and never afraid to take risks. Making friends can be difficult but he does that in his own way. He was able to come close with Eijirou Kirishima and trusts him immensely.</p>

          <figcaption>Fanart by ____</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Katsuki is a young man of average height, with a slim but muscular build and lightly tanned skin. He has short, spiky ash blond hair that choppy bangs that come to his eyebrows. His eyes are sharp and thin, and are bright red in color.</p>

        <p>At school, he wears the standard U.A. uniform without the customary red tie. Underneath his blazer, he wears a white collared shirt with the top few buttons undone. His pants are worn loosely, causing them to sag at his ankles, despite him wearing a belt in them.</p>

        <p>His hero costume is composed of a tight, black, sleeveless tank top, with an orange “X” across the middle, forming a v-neck. There are two dots along the left line of his collar, indicating the support company that designed his costume.[2] His costume also has a metallic neck brace worn with rectangular ends that have three holes in each side. His sleeves reach from within his large grenade-like gauntlets to his biceps. His belt, which also carries grenades, holds up his baggy pants with knee guards, below which he sports black, knee-high combat boots with orange soles and eyelets. His mask is jagged and black, and as it goes around his eyes, a large, orange-rimmed flare shape protrudes from each side.</p>

        <p>In the winter months, he wears a large jacket with a high collar, rather than the usual tank top, although it does have the same orange “X” design, so he can still sweat a sufficient amount, which is how his Quirk works.</p>

        <p>While interning under Best Jeanist, he wore a pair of blue jeans along with his hero costume rather than his usual baggy pants. His hair was also combed during this tenure, and parted to one side.</p>

        <p>Katsuki Bakugou is usually referred to Bakugou by his peers, although he has been given the name by a childhood friend/rival Izuku Midoriya. In the beginning of both the manga series and anime adaptation he is shown to be fierce and overly self confident. He is sure of his own success and considers others “extras”, soon later he is seen calling Izuku Midoriya “Deku”</p>
      </span>
      <span><!--PERSONALITY-->
        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <p>Katsuki is a crude, arrogant, and aggressive person, especially at the beginning of the series. Katsuki tends to come off as an anti-hero, if not downright villainous for those not familiar with him. This problematic behavior goes all the way back to his early childhood days when he was known to bully a young, Quirkless Izuku Midoriya. However, after being accepted into U.A. High School and experiencing several personal defeats, one of them even coming from Izuku, Katsuki has gradually changed into a less antagonistic person, albeit still retaining a lot of his unpleasant traits.</p>

        <p>Determined and thirsty for victory, Katsuki smiles eerily when in the middle of a battle. He is incredibly focused on achieving his own authentic victories and has learned to never underestimate his opponents. Katsuki is not only very talented at fighting, but also very intelligent and extremely perceptive, capable of strategic planning and holding some of the highest grades in his class, to the point that some even consider him a natural genius.</p>

        <p>While a rather volatile hero-in-training, with his volatile nature being seen as villainous by many outside of his class, Katsuki is smart enough to discern who his enemies and allies are. He is not known to be particularly warm and open with the people on his side, but will act less unfriendly and sometimes even kind to those that manage to earn his respect. Because of his attitude and vulgar language, Katsuki's U.A. classmates often react negatively to him, although they have come to appreciate his skills and warm up to his personality. Katsuki matures slowly, coming to befriend his classmates and engaging in social interaction with his fellow classmates, though remaining aloof and solitary for the most part.</p>

        <p>Katsuki will activate his Quirk for a number of reasons (to intimidate someone, to punctuate a point, out of frustration, or if feels like showing off). Katsuki values honesty highly and never lies. He is never afraid of speaking what's on his mind and will notice when people are not being truthful to him. This shows that Katsuki has good judgement of character.</p>

        <p>Due to the constant praise of his abilities and his powerful Quirk, Katsuki developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything. Katsuki loves to win above all else and cannot stand it when he doesn't, leading him to lose his already short temper or sulk. He is fiercely competitive. He values hard work and fair play and will refuse to acknowledge a winning result if he feels that his victory was not earned fairly. He detests being looked down by others and will hold contempt towards those that don't take him seriously, while recognizing the effort of those that manage to put up a challenge against him. He fails to acknowledge the fact that he himself is being condescending towards others and gets irate at times when someone has the courage to not back down from battling him despite having disadvantages.</p>

        <figure class="img3">
          <img src="img/" alt="Fan Art" />
          <figcaption>Fanart by ____</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Katsuki is immensely prideful and prefers to act alone. At the beginning of the series, Katsuki's cooperativeness was nothing short of atrocious, often ignoring his partners' ideas and suggestions for his own very direct approaches. His teamwork skills gradually improve, but Katsuki still comes off as condescending to his teammates. Although he now protects them from harm while expecting them to do the same for him in return.</p>

        <p>He often has difficulty accepting his mistakes and shortcomings, and will fiercely deny them whenever they are pointed out by others. Despite this, he has come to realize his flaws in certain areas and has somewhat improved on them. Even when vastly stronger and superior heroes point out his flaws he rarely ever takes them seriously and mostly dismisses their points.</p>

        <p>Katsuki's pride has cost him victories on numerous occasions. His pride is so intense that when pitted together with Izuku against All Might he outright refused his partner's help, even saying that he'd rather lose than work with Izuku to pass the exam. However Katsuki was able to put his pride aside temporarily in order to cooperate with Izuku effectively.</p>

        <p>Katsuki has a more vulnerable side, having been led to tears due to damaged pride a few times. Katsuki has also shown moments of fear and guilt, the latter due to viewing himself and his own weakness as the cause of All Might losing his remaining power and retiring as a hero. Still, due to years of misunderstandings, tension and pride, Katsuki has difficulty doing the same thing towards Izuku.</p>

        <p>While his inspiration for becoming a hero was the same as Izuku's, the Symbol of Peace, All Might, their beliefs differ: Katsuki feels a hero should never stop fighting or give up, regardless of the threat they face, and that always winning is the mark of a true hero. Due to his arrogant and conceited behavior, various heroes, civilians, and even villains have commented on it. However, Katsuki is unwavering in his aspirations of heroism, having outright refused Tomura Shigaraki's offer for him to join the League of Villains.</p>
      </span>
      <span><!--ABILITIES-->
        <h1>Abilities</h1>
        <p><strong>Overall Abilities:</strong> Katsuki has proven to be one of the strongest students in Class 1-A, earning 3rd place in the Quirk Apprehension Test, while placing first place in both the U.A. Entrance Exam and U.A. Sports Festival. Katsuki's fighting style is all-out offense, using his Quirk's propulsive abilities to close the distance between him and his opponents, followed by a bombardment of close-range attacks that often start with a powerful right hook. Katsuki is able to use his Explosion to propel himself through mid-air, blind opponents, and release long-range blasts. Explosion is a versatile Quirk, especially for battle situations, as the recoil caused by the blasts can be exploited by Katsuki for mobility purposes.
        </p>

        <p>During the U.S.J. Incident, Katsuki was able to singlehandedly overpower and immobilize Kurogiri, a highly capable villain. At the Sports Festival, he was able to defeat two of the strongest students in Class 1-A. When battling Shoto, Katsuki was able to pressure and overpower him. Even though Shoto was defeated by Katsuki in the Sports Festival, Katsuki acknowledges that Shoto should have won their battle if had used his full power. Many notable Pro Heroes have praised Katsuki's prowess; even the League of Villains have taken notice of Katsuki's strength and went as far as kidnapping him. After being released from his restraints by the League of Villains, Katsuki was able to take Tomura Shigaraki by surprise by unleashing an explosion at close-range. He was confident he could take out some villains before escaping. While Katsuki did hold his own against the Villain Alliance at the Nomu Factory, he found himself struggling against the villains that had surrounded them.
        </p>

        <p>At the beginning of his second battle against Izuku, Katsuki was able to overpower him when the latter was using 5% of One For All. When Izuku raised his power to 8% and fought on par with Katsuki, the blonde was still was able to hold his own. In spite of Izuku's drastic improvement, Katsuki won the battle. During the Joint Training Arc, Katsuki has displayed that, despite the cold weather conditions of the winter season weakening his Quirk, he can still fight efficiently. Katsuki has also become less insubordinate when paired with people and has developed a degree of camaraderie. With the help of his teammates, Katsuki defeated Setsuna Tokage, the strongest student in Class 1-B that was thought to have the potential of defeating Katsuki.
        </p>

        <!--This was a bullet point on the site-->
        <p><strong>Enhanced Strength:</strong> Katsuki possesses above-average physical strength, as he is can use his Grenade Bracers without any recoil, whereas Izuku nearly dislocated his arm just from using one. Katsuki was also able to use his physical strength to go toe-to-toe with Izuku.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Keen Intellect:</strong> Despite his looks, Katsuki has proven to be extremely intelligent and strategic. While sometimes he doesn’t have preemptive strategies, he does analyze his opponents weakenesses in the midst of battle. However Katsuki sometimes overlooks minor, crucial details. After he intentionally lunged himself at Kurogiri Katsuki was able to figure out part of Kurogiri's physical body has to be present when using his Warp Gate; so he targeted that part and successfully immobilized Kurogiri. When fighting weaker villains at the U.S.J., Katsuki quickly assessed which of the attacking villains were the most dangerous threat in the long term.</p>

        <p>During the Cavalry Battle he formed a successful strategy using the quirks of his teammates in order to get the headbands of Neito Monoma. In his battle with Ochaco Uraraka, he surmised she had a plan prepared to use against him. In the battles against Eijiro and Fumikage, Katsuki barraged them with explosions, weakening their respective Quirks. When paired with Izuku in the final exams, Katsuki came up with a compromise that involved him and Izuku using his Grenade Bracers to unleash maximum firepower at point-blank range to stun All Might in order to pass through the espace gate.</p>

        <p>Pro Heroes have mentioned his great potential and battle-sense. Shota Aizawa stated that in battle Katsuki shines his brightest. His intellect can be shown through midterm scores, where Katsuki scored 3rd place. Since the League of Villains took Katsuki to their hideout and explained their plan to recruit him, Katsuki correctly deduced the villains needed him alive. While fighting Shishikura, Katsuki anticipated being victim to his quirk and tossed a grenade to Denki Kaminari, so he could free him. This strategy ended up allowing him to be free and win the match.</p>

        <p>Katsuki was also able to piece together the truth of Izuku's Quirk after being kidnapped by the League of Villains. Seeing All For One steal Quirks which coincided with Izuku's words of getting a Quirk, he correctly deduced it came from All Might - with whom he noticed Izuku had a connection to. Because of this, Katsuki could be considered a natural born genius.</p>

        <!--This was a bullet point on the site-->
        <p><strong>Leadership Skills:</strong> During round four of the Joint Training, Setsuna Tokage admitted that even if her team had attacked him all at once, they stood no chance of victory. In the end, despite Class 1-B's exceptional teamwork and Tokage's strategic planning, they failed to capture a single member of Katsuki's team, mostly thanks to Katsuki's efforts, adaptability, and skills.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Musical Talent:</strong> As shown during the U.A. School Festival Arc, Katsuki is highly skilled at playing a drum kit, having gone through classes in the past.</p>

      <span><!--QUIRK-->
        <h1>Quirk</h1>
        <p><strong>Explosion (爆破 Bakuha):</strong> Katsuki's Quirk allows him to secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat from his palms and detonate it at will to create explosions. The more Katsuki sweats, the stronger his explosions become. As stated by Best Jeanist, Katsuki has a strong grasp on the applications of his Quirk.</p>

        <p>Katsuki usually uses small, powerful explosions from his hands to not only blast his opponents but to propel himself and navigate through the air as well. He can keep up his explosions long enough to break through Eijiro's hardening Quirk, and negate Shoto's Giant Ice Wall for short while before being overwhelmed. The blasts are powerful enough to send Katsuki flying at his opponents without much time for them to react, and he can use them swiftly enough to evade incoming attacks, even in the air.</p>

        <p>As part of his training, Katsuki submerged his hands into boiling water to expand his sweat glands, then create chain explosions to increase the scale of his attacks.</p>

        <!--This was technically a diff section, but I wanna combine them-->
        <strong>Super Moves</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blast Rush Turbo (爆速ターボ <em>Bakusoku Tābo</em>):</strong> Katsuki throws his hands back and uses explosions to propel himself. He uses this both on the ground to increase his speed and through the air to achieve a pseudo form of flight. He first used this technique on the ground during the Quirk Apprehension Test. The first time he used it to fly was during the Obstacle Race.</li>

          <li><strong>Stun Grenade (閃光弾 <em>Sutan Gurenēdo</em>):</strong> Katsuki starts by creating a sphere of light between his hands that explodes into a large scale flash. Similar to the effect of an actual stun grenade, the flash of light blinds anyone close by. He first used this technique to defeat Fumikage Tokoyami.</li>

            <ul><li><strong>Zero Distance Stun Grenade (ゼロ距離閃光弾 <em>Zero Kyori Sutan Gurenēdo</em>):</strong> A variation where Katsuki fires off his Stun Grenade at point blank range of the opponent to immediately stun and immobilize them with little lasting damage. [16] This variation was first used against Setsuna in the fourth round of the Joint Training Battle.</li></ul>

          <li><strong>Howitzer Impact (榴弾砲着弾 <em>Hauzā Inpakuto</em>):</strong> This move is the strongest move in Katsuki's arsenal, which involves Katsuki taking to the air, and then using explosions to propel himself in a circular motion to create a tornado. This tornado builds up oxygen to fuel the incoming explosion. After colliding with the target, Katsuki releases the powerful aforementioned explosion. Present Mic compared the effectiveness of the technique to that of an actual missile. Katsuki first used Howitzer Impact in the final match of the U.A. Sports Festival Finals.[17] He has also shown that he can release the fueled explosion in midair, without having to make contact with the target.</li>

          <li><strong>AP Shot (徹甲弾 <em>Ei-Pī Shotto</em>):</strong> Katsuki stretches out one of his hands and uses his other hand to form a circle on the palm of his outstretched hand. Katsuki then fires an explosion through the circle, which creates a concentrated blast beam. By focusing the path of his explosions into a single point instead of around his whole palm, Katsuki creates a concentrated blast with reduced area of impact, but with enough power to successfully pierce solid concrete.</li>

            <ul><li><strong>AP Shot: Auto-Cannon (徹甲弾機関銃 <em>Ei Pī Shotto Ōtokanon</em>):</strong> A rapid-fire version of his AP Shot Technique. The explosion power is reduced in order to avoid dealing severe damage to human targets. This variation was first used against Seiji Shishikura in the first stage of the Provisional Hero License Exam.</li></ul>

          <li><strong>Explode-A-Pult (爆破式カタパルト <em>Ekusu Kataparuto</em>):</strong> While in mid-air, Katsuki grabs an opponent with one of his arms, then propels himself in a spinning motion by firing explosions with his free arm. Once he gains enough momentum, Katsuki forcefully throws his opponent with the aid of another explosion. He first used this technique against Togaru Kamakiri in the fourth round of the Joint Training Battle.</li>
        </ul>

      <span><!--TRIVIA-->
        <h1>Trivia</h1><!--These were all bulletpoints-->
        <ul>
          <li>Originally, Katsuki was a very kind and gentle character who spoke without thinking and unintentionally insulted others. Horikoshi, however, found this original draft to be boring and decided, while still keeping him a natural born genius, to make him an unpleasant character instead.</li>

          <li>In later concepts, Katsuki would adopt the Hero Name "Ground Zero" at some point. In the series proper, Katsuki still doesn't have a known Hero Name, as his proposed ones were rejected by Midnight due to their overly violent nature.</li>

          <li>Katsuki's name is composed of "baku" (爆) from "bakuha" (爆破 lit. <em>"explosion"</em>) and "ka(tsu)" (勝) from "katsu" (勝つ lit. "to win").</li>

          <li>Katsuki likes spicy food and mountain climbing.</li>
