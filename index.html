        <p class="boxoinfo">Katsuki Bakugou (爆豪 勝己) is one of the main characters in the manga and anime Boku no Hero Acadamia (aka My Hero Acadamia). He is one of the many students in Class 1-A of the U.A. First Year Classes. The series is made by Kohei Horikoshi.</p>

        <p>He usually referred to Bakugou by his peers, although he has been given the name by a childhood friend/rival Izuku Midoriya. In the beginning of both the manga series and anime adaptation he is shown to be fierce and overly self confident. He is sure of his own success and considers others “extras”, soon later he is seen calling Izuku Midoriya “Deku” (meaning ‘useless’ in Japanese) continuing on to destroying Midoriya’s book about heroes. Although at first Bakugou seemed rude throughout the anime and manga it is clear he has other sides to him. He looks up to All Might (the top Pro-Hero in Japan) and strives to be just like him. He’s courageous and never afraid to take risks. Making friends can be difficult but he does that in his own way. He was able to come close with Eijirou Kirishima and trusts him immensely.</p>
