        <p class="boxoinfo">Katsuki Bakugou (爆豪 勝己) is one of the main characters in the manga and anime Boku no Hero Acadamia (aka My Hero Acadamia). He is one of the many students in Class 1-A of the U.A. First Year Classes. The series is made by Kohei Horikoshi.</p>

        <p>Katsuki Bakugo is usually referred to Bakugou by his peers, although he has been given the name by a childhood friend/rival Izuku Midoriya. In the beginning of both the manga series and anime adaptation he is shown to be fierce and overly self confident. He is sure of his own success and considers others “extras”, soon later he is seen calling Izuku Midoriya “Deku” (meaning ‘useless’ in Japanese) continuing on to destroying Midoriya’s book about heroes.</p>

        <p>Although at first Bakugou seemed rude throughout the anime and manga it is clear he has other sides to him. He looks up to All Might (the top Pro-Hero in Japan) and strives to be just like him. He’s courageous and never afraid to take risks. Making friends can be difficult but he does that in his own way. He was able to come close with Eijirou Kirishima and trusts him immensely.</p>

        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>Katsuki is a young man of average height, with a slim but muscular build and lightly tanned skin. He has short, spiky ash blond hair that choppy bangs that come to his eyebrows. His eyes are sharp and thin, and are bright red in color.</p>

        <p>At school, he wears the standard U.A. uniform without the customary red tie. Underneath his blazer, he wears a white collared shirt with the top few buttons undone. His pants are worn loosely, causing them to sag at his ankles, despite him wearing a belt in them.</p>

        <p>His hero costume is composed of a tight, black, sleeveless tank top, with an orange “X” across the middle, forming a v-neck. There are two dots along the left line of his collar, indicating the support company that designed his costume.[2] His costume also has a metallic neck brace worn with rectangular ends that have three holes in each side. His sleeves reach from within his large grenade-like gauntlets to his biceps. His belt, which also carries grenades, holds up his baggy pants with knee guards, below which he sports black, knee-high combat boots with orange soles and eyelets. His mask is jagged and black, and as it goes around his eyes, a large, orange-rimmed flare shape protrudes from each side.</p>

        <p>In the winter months, he wears a large jacket with a high collar, rather than the usual tank top, although it does have the same orange “X” design, so he can still sweat a sufficient amount, which is how his Quirk works.</p>

        <p>While interning under Best Jeanist, he wore a pair of blue jeans along with his hero costume rather than his usual baggy pants. His hair was also combed during this tenure, and parted to one side.</p>

        <h1>Equipment (Hero Costume)</h1>
        <p>Katsuki Bakugou is usually referred to Bakugou by his peers, although he has been given the name by a childhood friend/rival Izuku Midoriya. In the beginning of both the manga series and anime adaptation he is shown to be fierce and overly self confident. He is sure of his own success and considers others “extras”, soon later he is seen calling Izuku Midoriya “Deku”</p>
      </span>
      <span>
        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <p>Katsuki is a crude, arrogant, and aggressive person, especially at the beginning of the series. Katsuki tends to come off as an anti-hero, if not downright villainous for those not familiar with him. This problematic behavior goes all the way back to his early childhood days when he was known to bully a young, Quirkless Izuku Midoriya. However, after being accepted into U.A. High School and experiencing several personal defeats, one of them even coming from Izuku, Katsuki has gradually changed into a less antagonistic person, albeit still retaining a lot of his unpleasant traits.</p>

        <p>Determined and thirsty for victory, Katsuki smiles eerily when in the middle of a battle. He is incredibly focused on achieving his own authentic victories and has learned to never underestimate his opponents. Katsuki is not only very talented at fighting, but also very intelligent and extremely perceptive, capable of strategic planning and holding some of the highest grades in his class, to the point that some even consider him a natural genius.</p>

        <p>While a rather volatile hero-in-training, with his volatile nature being seen as villainous by many outside of his class, Katsuki is smart enough to discern who his enemies and allies are. He is not known to be particularly warm and open with the people on his side, but will act less unfriendly and sometimes even kind to those that manage to earn his respect. Because of his attitude and vulgar language, Katsuki's U.A. classmates often react negatively to him, although they have come to appreciate his skills and warm up to his personality. Katsuki matures slowly, coming to befriend his classmates and engaging in social interaction with his fellow classmates, though remaining aloof and solitary for the most part.</p>

        <p>Katsuki will activate his Quirk for a number of reasons (to intimidate someone, to punctuate a point, out of frustration, or if feels like showing off). Katsuki values honesty highly and never lies. He is never afraid of speaking what's on his mind and will notice when people are not being truthful to him. This shows that Katsuki has good judgement of character.</p>

        <p>Due to the constant praise of his abilities and his powerful Quirk, Katsuki developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything. Katsuki loves to win above all else and cannot stand it when he doesn't, leading him to lose his already short temper or sulk. He is fiercely competitive. He values hard work and fair play and will refuse to acknowledge a winning result if he feels that his victory was not earned fairly. He detests being looked down by others and will hold contempt towards those that don't take him seriously, while recognizing the effort of those that manage to put up a challenge against him. He fails to acknowledge the fact that he himself is being condescending towards others and gets irate at times when someone has the courage to not back down from battling him despite having disadvantages.</p>

        <p>Katsuki is immensely prideful and prefers to act alone, as he hates the idea of having to rely on others to assist him unless he is recognized as the absolute leading figure within a team. At the beginning of the series, Katsuki's cooperativeness was nothing short of atrocious, often ignoring his partners' ideas and suggestions for his own very direct approaches. After a while, his teamwork skills gradually improve, but Katsuki still comes off as condescending to his teammates due to his usual tone, but he now acknowledges their importance, protecting them from harm while expecting them to do the same for him in return.</p>

        <p>He often has difficulty accepting his mistakes and shortcomings, and will fiercely deny them whenever they are pointed out by others. Despite this, he has come to realize his flaws in certain areas and has somewhat improved on them, although he still never admits them due to his pride. Even when vastly stronger and superior heroes, such as Best Jeanist, point out his flaws and other key aspects about improving, he rarely ever takes them seriously and mostly dismisses their points.</p>

        <p>Katsuki's pride has cost him victories on numerous occasions, like the Battle Trial and the Provisional Hero License Exam. His pride is so intense that, when pitted together with Izuku against All Might, he outright refused his partner's help, even saying that he'd rather lose than work with Izuku to pass the exam by using Izuku's abilities and power. However, after realizing the true difficulty of the exam and being lectured by Izuku, Katsuki was able to put his pride aside temporarily in order to cooperate with Izuku effectively.</p>

        <p>Katsuki has a more vulnerable side, having been led to tears due to damaged pride a few times. Katsuki has also shown moments of fear and guilt, the latter due to viewing himself and his own weakness as the cause of All Might losing his remaining power and retiring as a hero. Still, due to years of misunderstandings, tension and pride, Katsuki has difficulty doing the same thing towards Izuku. Because of his pride, he has no little tolerance of failure whatso ever.</p>

        <p>While his inspiration for becoming a hero was the same as Izuku's, the Symbol of Peace, All Might, their beliefs differ: Katsuki feels a hero should never stop fighting or give up, regardless of the threat they face, and that always winning is the mark of a true hero. Furthermore, due to his arrogant and conceited behavior, various heroes, civilians, and even villains have commented on it. However, Katsuki is unwavering in his aspirations of heroism, having outright refused Tomura Shigaraki's offer for him to join the League of Villains, even after being offered the power and ability to 'win'.</p>
